I will be deploying this model as a simple web application
Next steps towards implementation:
 1) Decide on my method of deploying to a web framework
  - flask web app with react front end
  - Streamlit which takes alot of the effort of deploying out of my hands
 2) Design a deployment solution architecture
 3) Refactor my code into some nice modules that I can test and use independently
 4) Run my code End-to-End with Logging and Testing
 5) Implement my model using my deployment solution architecture
